## Security Issues (High Priority)

### Finding 5: Client-Side Admin Access Creates Security Risk for AI Provider Management

- **Files**: `src/hooks/useAdminAccess.ts`
- **Description**: Admin privileges are determined by a hardcoded email list in the client-side code. This is particularly concerning for TaleForge because admin access controls AI provider settings (OpenAI API keys, OVH AI Endpoints configuration), system monitoring, and the ability to manage the 118 stories and 137 segments in the system. Anyone can view the source code and see admin emails, and there's no server-side validation for sensitive AI provider operations.
- **Impact**: High - Could expose AI provider API keys and system configuration to unauthorized users
- **Proposed Solution**: Implement server-side admin role system with proper validation for AI provider operations.
- **Implementation Plan**:
  1. **TaleForge-Specific Approach**: Secure AI provider management and story administration
  2. Create proper admin role system in Supabase with user_roles table integration
  3. Move AI provider settings validation to server-side (Edge Functions)
  4. Update `useAdminAccess` to check server-side roles via RLS policies
  5. Add server-side validation for admin operations (AI provider config, story management)
  6. Implement proper audit logging for admin actions on AI systems
  7. Secure the admin monitoring dashboard for AI provider health tracking
  8. Remove hardcoded email list and implement proper role-based access control

- **TaleForge Note**: ⚠️ Critical for protecting AI provider API keys and system integrity

### Finding 6: Insufficient Input Validation for Story Generation Pipeline

- **Files**: Story creation forms, genre selection, story prompt inputs, AI generation parameters
- **Description**: While some security utilities exist in `utils/security.ts`, they're not consistently applied across TaleForge's story generation pipeline. With users creating stories from natural language prompts that get sent to OpenAI GPT-4o-mini, and with story content being processed for image generation (OVH AI Endpoints, OpenAI DALL-E), proper input validation and sanitization is crucial to prevent injection attacks and ensure AI providers receive clean, safe inputs.
- **Impact**: Medium-High - Could lead to malicious prompts being processed by AI providers or inappropriate content generation
- **Proposed Solution**: Implement comprehensive input validation for all story generation inputs.
- **Implementation Plan**:
  1. **TaleForge-Specific Approach**: Validate all inputs to AI generation pipeline
  2. Create story prompt validation (length limits, content filtering, harmful content detection)
  3. Validate genre selection and story customization parameters
  4. Implement input sanitization for OpenAI GPT-4o-mini prompts
  5. Add validation for image generation prompts sent to OVH AI Endpoints/DALL-E
  6. Validate user choices and story continuation inputs
  7. Implement rate limiting for story generation to prevent abuse
  8. Add content filtering for generated story segments before display
- **Status**: **RESOLVED** ✅ - Enhanced input validation with content filtering, rate limiting, and AI provider-specific validation
- **TaleForge Note**: ⚠️ Important for safe AI content generation and preventing abuse
