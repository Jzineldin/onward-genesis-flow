## ü§ñ AI Integration Deep Dive

### Text Generation Pipeline

OpenAI GPT-4o-mini with structured JSON output:

```json
{
  "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
  "messages": [
    { 
      "role": "system", 
      "content": "Master storyteller AI generating 120-200 word segments with 3 choices"
    },
    { "role": "user", "content": "userPrompt" }
  ],
  "temperature": 0.7,
  "response_format": { "type": "json_object" }
}
```

**Output Format**:

```json
{
  "segmentText": "Rich narrative segment (120-200 words)",
  "choices": ["Choice 1", "Choice 2", "Choice 3"],
  "isEnd": false,
  "imagePrompt": "Detailed visual description"
}
```

### Image Generation Strategy

-   **Primary Provider**: OVH AI Endpoints (Stable Diffusion XL)
    -   Fast generation (~18 seconds).
    -   High-quality fantasy/cinematic style.
    -   Cost-effective for volume.
-   **Fallback Provider**: OpenAI DALL-E
    -   Higher quality but more expensive.
    -   Used when OVH fails.
    -   Better prompt adherence.
-   **Enhancement Pipeline**:
    -   Dynamic prompt enrichment with visual context.
    -   Genre-specific styling ("epic fantasy illustration, cinematic lighting").
    -   Character consistency tracking (planned).

### Audio Generation

-   **Provider**: OpenAI TTS-1 with 'fable' voice.
-   **Format**: MP3 for web compatibility.
